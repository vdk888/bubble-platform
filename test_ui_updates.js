🧪 REAL-TIME UI UPDATES TEST CHECKLIST
=====================================

Follow this checklist to manually verify the UI update fixes:

📋 PRE-TEST SETUP:
------------------
1. ✅ Docker environment is running
2. ✅ Open browser to: http://localhost:3000
3. ✅ Open browser Developer Tools (F12) → Console tab
4. ✅ Login or register a test user account

📝 TEST SCENARIOS:
-----------------

🔍 TEST 1: Universe Creation and Selection
1. Click "Create Universe" button
2. Create a new universe (e.g., "Test Universe")
3. Verify universe appears in the list immediately
4. Click on the universe to select it
5. ✅ VERIFY: Universe details panel shows on the right
6. ✅ VERIFY: Asset count shows "0 Assets"

🔍 TEST 2: Real-Time Asset Addition  
1. In the selected universe detail panel, locate the "Add Asset" form
2. Enter "AAPL" in the symbol input field
3. Click "Add Asset" button or press Enter
4. ✅ VERIFY: "AAPL Adding..." appears immediately (optimistic UI)
5. Wait for API response (should be < 2 seconds)
6. ✅ VERIFY: Asset count updates from "0" to "1" immediately
7. ✅ VERIFY: AAPL row appears in the asset table immediately
8. ✅ VERIFY: AAPL shows validation status (pending/validated)
9. ✅ VERIFY: No page refresh required

🔍 TEST 3: Multiple Asset Addition
1. Add "GOOGL" using the same process
2. ✅ VERIFY: Asset count updates to "2" immediately
3. ✅ VERIFY: Both AAPL and GOOGL visible in table
4. Add "MSFT" 
5. ✅ VERIFY: Asset count updates to "3" immediately

🔍 TEST 4: Real-Time Asset Removal
1. Click the trash icon next to "GOOGL"
2. Confirm the deletion in the popup
3. ✅ VERIFY: "GOOGL Removing..." appears immediately (optimistic UI)
4. Wait for API response
5. ✅ VERIFY: Asset count updates from "3" to "2" immediately
6. ✅ VERIFY: GOOGL row disappears from table immediately
7. ✅ VERIFY: AAPL and MSFT still visible

🔍 TEST 5: Error Handling
1. Try to add an invalid symbol like "INVALID123"
2. ✅ VERIFY: Optimistic UI shows "Adding..." initially
3. ✅ VERIFY: Error message appears after API response
4. ✅ VERIFY: Optimistic UI is rolled back (asset doesn't stay)
5. ✅ VERIFY: Asset count remains unchanged

🔍 TEST 6: Universe List Synchronization
1. With universe selected and assets visible
2. Add another asset (e.g., "TSLA")
3. ✅ VERIFY: Universe list on the left also updates
4. ✅ VERIFY: If universe list shows asset count, it updates too

🔍 TEST 7: Console Debugging
1. Open browser console (F12 → Console)
2. Add an asset and watch console logs
3. ✅ VERIFY: You see logs like:
   - "🔄 Starting universe update synchronization..."
   - "📤 API: Adding assets to universe"
   - "📥 API: Add assets response"
   - "✅ Selected universe refreshed with updated data"
   - "✅ Universe update synchronization completed"

❌ FAILURE INDICATORS:
---------------------
- Asset count doesn't update after successful operations
- Need to refresh page to see changes
- Assets appear in table but count is wrong
- Error messages persist after successful operations
- Optimistic UI doesn't roll back on errors

📈 PERFORMANCE EXPECTATIONS:
---------------------------
- Optimistic UI updates: Immediate (< 100ms)
- API response time: < 2 seconds for asset operations
- UI synchronization: Complete within 3 seconds of API response
- No unnecessary API calls or infinite loops

🎯 SUCCESS CRITERIA:
-------------------
All operations should provide immediate visual feedback through optimistic UI,
followed by consistent state synchronization within 3 seconds, without requiring
any page refreshes or manual actions from the user.
