## ✅ **USER STORY ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA VERIFICATION**

### **User Story 1**: ✅ **100% COMPLETE**
> "As a user, I want to define a custom investment universe by manually selecting assets"

**Acceptance Criteria Met**:
- ✅ Users can add/remove assets manually → UniverseAssetTable.tsx inline editing
- ✅ Universes are saved, edited, and retrievable via API → Full CRUD implemented
- ✅ Asset validation occurs in real-time → Yahoo Finance + caching working

### **User Story 2**: ✅ **100% COMPLETE** 
> "As a user, I want to filter and screen assets based on metrics"

**Acceptance Criteria Met**:
- ✅ "Screener allows filtering by multiple metrics" → Market cap, P/E, dividend yield filters implemented
- ✅ "Filtered results can be added directly to universe" → AssetSearch integration with universes
- ✅ "Screener results update dynamically" → Real-time API calls with filter changes

### **User Story 3**: ✅ **100% COMPLETE**
> "As a user, I want to view my universe in a clean interface"

**Acceptance Criteria Met**:
- ✅ "Table view of assets with key metrics" → UniverseAssetTable displays all metadata
- ✅ "Editable list (add/remove from universe)" → Inline editing with validation
- ✅ "Real-time asset count and validation status" → Dashboard shows live metrics
