# Jira Backlog â€“ Investment Strategy App (Updated with Screener)
Epic 1 â€“ Universe Management (Advanced with Screener)

User Stories

As a user, I want to define a custom investment universe by manually selecting assets so that I can control which assets are included in my strategy.

Acceptance Criteria:

Users can add/remove assets manually.

Universes are saved, edited, and retrievable via API.

As a user, I want to filter and screen assets based on metrics (e.g., sector, market cap, P/E ratio, ROIC) so that I can create a universe using advanced criteria.

Acceptance Criteria:

Screener allows filtering by multiple metrics.

Filtered results can be added directly to the universe.

Screener results update dynamically.

As a user, I want to view my universe in a clean interface so that I can validate the assets I selected or filtered.

Acceptance Criteria:

Table view of assets with key metrics.

Editable list (add/remove from universe).

**As a user, I want to view my universe evolution over time so that I can understand how my investment universe has changed and avoid survivorship bias in backtesting.**

**Temporal Universe Acceptance Criteria:**

- **Users can view universe evolution timeline (monthly/quarterly snapshots)**
- **Timeline shows assets added/removed in each period with turnover rates**  
- **Universe screening creates historical snapshots, not just current updates**
- **Each snapshot preserves point-in-time composition with metadata (screening criteria, performance metrics)**
- **Users can view universe composition at any historical date**
- **Backtest validation includes turnover impact analysis with transaction cost estimates**
- **Universe changes are tracked with reasons (screening results, manual additions/removals)**
- **Timeline interface allows drilling down into specific periods to see detailed asset changes**

Epic 2 â€“ Indicators & Signals

User Stories

As a user, I want to attach indicators to my universe so that I can generate buy/sell signals.

Acceptance Criteria:

**Technical Implementation:**
- RSI calculation matches industry standards (14-period default, verified via unit tests)
- MACD signals generated using 12,26,9 default parameters with crossover detection
- Momentum indicators with configurable lookback periods and Â±2% signal thresholds
- Signal output format: pandas Series with standardized -1, 0, 1 values

**Data Validation & Quality:**
- Market data freshness validation (reject data older than 15 minutes)
- Input validation for OHLCV format, timestamp ordering, and data completeness
- Signal conflict resolution with priority hierarchy: MACD > RSI > Momentum
- All signal generation events logged with timestamps, parameters, and audit trail

**Performance Requirements:**
- Indicator calculations complete within 2 seconds for 1000 assets
- API endpoints respond within 500ms (95th percentile)
- Graceful error handling when indicator calculations fail

**API Functionality:**
- GET /api/v1/indicators/default returns proper configuration objects
- POST /api/v1/indicators/calculate processes market data and returns indicator signals
- POST /api/v1/signals/generate creates weighted composite signals from multiple indicators

As a user, I want to visualize signals on interactive charts so that I can understand when trades are triggered.

Acceptance Criteria:

Chart displays asset price with overlaid buy/sell markers.

Signals update dynamically when parameters change.

**As a user, I want access to professional-grade financial data through OpenBB integration so that I have institutional-quality data for analysis.**

**OpenBB Integration Acceptance Criteria:**

**Data Integration & Quality:**
- OpenBB Terminal SDK integrated as primary data provider with fallback chain
- Fundamental data includes financial statements, ratios, and sector comparisons
- Economic indicators (GDP, inflation, unemployment) available for macro analysis
- News sentiment analysis provides scored sentiment data for assets
- Analyst estimates and insider trading data accessible through unified API
- Data quality monitoring compares OpenBB results with Yahoo/Alpha Vantage for validation

**Performance & Reliability:**
- OpenBB data requests complete within 1 second for fundamental data
- Error handling: Graceful fallback to Yahoo Finance if OpenBB fails
- Cost tracking: Monitor OpenBB usage to optimize between free and premium tiers
- Provider health monitoring with automatic failover

**API Enhancement Requirements:**
- GET /api/v1/market-data/fundamentals returns OpenBB fundamental data
- GET /api/v1/market-data/economics provides economic indicator time series
- GET /api/v1/market-data/news-sentiment delivers scored news sentiment
- GET /api/v1/market-data/analyst-estimates provides consensus analyst data
- GET /api/v1/market-data/insider-trading provides insider activity tracking
- All endpoints maintain consistent response format with existing APIs

**Integration Testing:**
- Triple-provider fallback chain (OpenBB â†’ Yahoo â†’ Alpha Vantage) tested under failure scenarios
- Data consistency validation between providers with conflict resolution
- Performance benchmarks for all new OpenBB endpoints
- Cost monitoring and usage optimization for OpenBB API calls
