Portfolio weights are stored and retrievable with historical evolution tracking.

**Strategy-Universe integration ensures allocation rules adapt to universe changes over time.**

As a user, I want to run a temporal backtest of my portfolio that eliminates survivorship bias so that I can validate realistic performance.
