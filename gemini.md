This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## üìö **CRITICAL: Planning Documentation Reference**

**BEFORE starting ANY task, you MUST consult the relevant planning documents in `planning/` directory.**

### Planning Documentation Map
Use these files to understand requirements, context, and implementation approach for any task:

| File | Purpose | When to Consult |
|------|---------|----------------|
| **`planning/0_dev.md`** | Complete developer roadmap (Junior‚ÜíSenior), best practices, security patterns, testing frameworks | ALL development tasks, architecture decisions, quality standards |
| **`planning/1_spec.md`** | Original product specification, core components, system requirements | Feature development, API design, system architecture |
| **`planning/2_jira.md`** | User stories, acceptance criteria, epic breakdown | Feature implementation, testing requirements, acceptance criteria |
| **`planning/3_directory_structure.md`** | Complete microservices architecture, file organization | Code organization, service splitting, structure decisions |
| **`planning/4_plan_overview.md`** | High-level architecture vision, microservices overview | Architecture decisions, service design, system overview |
| **`planning/5_plan_phased.md`** | Detailed implementation phases, file structure | Implementation planning, phased development approach |

| **`planning/Sprint2_progress_tracking.md`** | Current sprint progress, task status | Current sprint context, progress updates |

### **MANDATORY WORKFLOW: Documentation-First Approach**

**For EVERY task, follow this sequence:**

1. **üìñ READ FIRST**: Before writing any code, search and read the relevant planning documents
   ```bash
   # Example: For universe screening feature
   # Read: planning/1_spec.md (Universe Definition section)
   # Read: planning/2_jira.md (Epic 1 - Universe Management)
   # Read: planning/0_dev.md (Interface-First Design patterns)
   ```

2. **üéØ UNDERSTAND CONTEXT**: Extract specific requirements, patterns, and constraints
   - What are the exact acceptance criteria?
   - What architectural patterns should be used?
   - What security requirements apply?
   - What performance targets must be met?

3. **üèóÔ∏è PLAN IMPLEMENTATION**: Design approach based on documentation
   - Follow Interface-First Design methodology
   - Apply security-by-design principles  
   - Use real data testing patterns
   - Meet performance SLA requirements

4. **üíª IMPLEMENT**: Code according to documented standards and patterns

5. **‚úÖ VALIDATE**: Ensure implementation meets all documented requirements

### **Key Principle**: 
**NEVER assume or guess requirements.** The planning documents contain precise specifications, patterns, and standards. Always consult them first to ensure consistency with the overall architecture and quality standards.

## Development Philosophy & Standards

### Target Level: Senior Developer (Top 1%)
This codebase targets **senior-level engineering standards** with production-grade patterns from Day 1. We're building the MVP as a lightweight version of the full microservices architecture, but with all the foundational quality measures in place.

### Core Principles
1. **Interface-First Design**: Define contracts before implementation (enables parallel development, testing with mocks, implementation flexibility)
2. **Security-By-Design**: Security integrated from Day 1, not added later (password hashing, JWT, RLS, audit trails)
3. **Real Data Testing**: Always test with actual API calls, not mocks (no placeholders, real validation)
4. **Production-Ready from Start**: Include monitoring, logging, error handling from MVP
5. **Clean Architecture**: Business logic in services, not in controllers/views (MVC pattern, SOLID principles)
6. **Test Pyramid**: 60-70% unit, 20-30% integration, 5-10% E2E tests
7. **Documentation as Code**: Living documentation, Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

## Project Overview
The Bubble Platform is an AI-native investment strategy automation platform designed to automate the construction, monitoring, and execution of investment strategies. The platform transforms idea ‚Üí strategy ‚Üí portfolio ‚Üí orders ‚Üí notifications in an automated workflow.

### Core Components
1. **Universe Definition** (What do I buy?) - Define investment universes with dynamic screening
2. **Indicators & Signals** (When do I buy?) - Technical indicators (RSI, MACD, Momentum) with signal generation
3. **Portfolio Strategy** (How much do I buy?) - Allocation rules and backtesting
4. **Master Portfolio** - Risk parity aggregation of multiple strategies ("pockets")
5. **Broker Execution** - Automated multi-broker order routing and execution

### Architecture Evolution
- **MVP**: Monolithic FastAPI backend with React frontend
- **V1**: Microservices architecture with 6 core services
- **V2**: Full enterprise features with AI agent, alternative data, and advanced risk management

### Key Technical Features
- Multi-tenant architecture with PostgreSQL Row-Level Security (RLS)
- Dynamic universe screening with ROIC-based filters and sector analysis
- Background processing with Celery/Redis for async operations
- Real-time data validation with Alpha Vantage, Yahoo Finance, and alternative data sources

## Architecture & Patterns

### Backend Structure
- **Interface-First Design**: Define contracts (interfaces) BEFORE implementation in `app/services/interfaces/`
  - Enables parallel development, better testing with mocks, and flexibility to swap implementations
  - Example: `IScreener` interface with `FundamentalScreener`, `TechnicalScreener` implementations
- **Multi-tenant isolation**: PostgreSQL RLS policies automatically filter data by tenant_id
- **Background processing**: Celery workers handle async tasks with dedicated queues:
  - `validation` queue: Asset validation and enrichment
  - `bulk_validation` queue: Bulk universe operations
  - `maintenance` queue: Periodic maintenance tasks
- **Service layer pattern**: Business logic in services, not in API endpoints
- **Feature flags**: Dynamic feature control via `/api/v1/features/` endpoint

### Key Service Interfaces
- `IDataProvider`: Abstract interface for market data (Yahoo, Alpha Vantage, mock implementations)
- `IScreener`: Interface for universe screening (fundamental, technical, composite screeners)
- `IAssetValidation`: Interface for validating and enriching asset data
- `IAIAgent`: Interface for conversational AI with tool calling capabilities
- `IBacktestEngine`: Interface for backtesting engines (basic, VectorBT, QuantConnect)

### Authentication & Security
- JWT-based authentication with tenant isolation
- All API endpoints require authentication except: `/health`, `/ready`, `/docs`, `/features`
- Rate limiting configured per endpoint type (auth: 10/min, general: 100/min, backtesting: 5/min)
- Input sanitization and audit logging middleware

### Testing Philosophy
- **Real data testing**: Tests use actual API calls to validate integrations
- **Comprehensive coverage**: Unit, integration, security, and business logic tests
- **Test markers**: Use pytest markers to categorize and run specific test suites
- **Isolated test environment**: Separate test database and Redis instances

## API Endpoints

### Health & Monitoring
- `GET /health/` - Basic health check
- `GET /health/ready` - Database connectivity check
- `GET /health/metrics` - System metrics and performance data
- `GET /health/worker` - Celery worker status

### Core Features
- `/api/v1/auth/` - Authentication (register, login, token refresh)
- `/api/v1/universes/` - Universe management with dynamic screening capabilities
- `/api/v1/assets/` - Asset validation and enrichment with real-time data
- `/api/v1/features/` - Feature flag management
- `/api/v1/indicators/` - Technical indicator calculations (RSI, MACD, Momentum)
- `/api/v1/signals/` - Signal generation with weighted composite signals
- `/api/v1/portfolios/` - Portfolio management and risk parity allocation
- `/api/v1/backtests/` - Strategy backtesting with multiple engines

## Database Schema

### Multi-tenant Design
All tables include `tenant_id` for isolation:
- Users table: Authentication and tenant association
- Universes table: Investment universe definitions
- Assets table: Global asset registry
- UniverseAssets table: Universe-specific asset tracking

### Migrations
Database changes tracked through Alembic migrations in `backend/alembic/versions/`

## Environment Variables

### Required for Development
```bash
SECRET_KEY=your-development-secret-key
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///./bubble_dev.db  # Or PostgreSQL for production-like
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
CLAUDE_API_KEY=your-claude-api-key      # For AI agent functionality
ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY=your-av-key       # For market data
```

### Testing Environment
```bash
DATABASE_TEST_URL=sqlite:///./bubble_test.db
ENVIRONMENT=testing
DEBUG=false
```

## Technical Indicators Specification

### Supported Indicators
1. **RSI (Relative Strength Index)**
   - 14-period default, configurable
   - Signals: Overbought (>70), Oversold (<30)
   - Output: -1 (sell), 0 (hold), 1 (buy)

2. **MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)**
   - Parameters: 12,26,9 (fast, slow, signal)
   - Signals: Crossover detection
   - Priority: Highest in conflict resolution

3. **Momentum**
   - Configurable lookback periods
   - Signal thresholds: ¬±2%
   - Simple rate of change calculation

### Signal Generation Rules
- **Output Format**: Standardized pandas Series with -1, 0, 1 values
- **Composite Signals**: Weighted combination with configurable weights
- **Conflict Resolution**: MACD > RSI > Momentum hierarchy
- **Data Validation**: Reject market data older than 15 minutes
- **Performance**: <2 seconds for 1000 assets calculation

## Microservices Roadmap

## Common Development Tasks

### Adding New API Endpoint
1. Define interface in `backend/app/services/interfaces/`
2. Implement service in `backend/app/services/`
3. Create API router in `backend/app/api/v1/`
4. Include router in `backend/app/main.py`
5. Add comprehensive tests in `backend/app/tests/`

### Adding New Model
1. Create model in `backend/app/models/`
2. Import in `backend/app/models/__init__.py`
3. Generate migration: `alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Add ModelName"`
4. Apply migration: `alembic upgrade head`

### Implementing Background Task
1. Define task in `backend/app/workers/`
2. Configure queue in Celery worker command
3. Add task invocation in relevant service
4. Test with real worker running

### Interface-First Design Workflow
When adding new functionality, ALWAYS follow this pattern:

```python
# 1. Define the interface FIRST
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class IScreener(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    async def screen_universe(
        self, 
        criteria: ScreeningCriteria, 
        date: datetime
    ) -> List[ScreeningResult]:
        pass

# 2. Update existing code to accept interface
class SignalEngine:
    def __init__(self, screener: IScreener):  # Interface, not implementation
        self.screener = screener

# 3. Implement the interface
class FundamentalScreener(IScreener):
    async def screen_universe(self, criteria, date):
        # Actual implementation
        pass

# 4. Use dependency injection
screener = FundamentalScreener(data_provider)
signal_engine = SignalEngine(screener=screener)
```

This approach enables:
- Parallel development by multiple team members
- Easy testing with mock implementations
- Flexibility to swap implementations without refactoring
- Clear contracts between components

## Testing Best Practices

### Always Test with Real Data
- Use actual API responses, not mocks
- Validate external service integrations
- Test rate limiting and error handling
- Verify multi-tenant isolation

### Run Comprehensive Tests Before Changes
```bash
cd backend
python run_tests.py  # Runs all tests with clean output
```

## Performance Considerations

### Caching Strategy
- Redis caching for frequently accessed data
- Asset validation results cached for 24 hours
- Universe compositions cached with invalidation on update

### Background Processing
- Asset validation runs asynchronously via Celery
- Bulk operations processed in dedicated queues
- Worker health monitoring via `/health/worker` endpoint

## Security Requirements

### Security-First Development
Security is integrated from Day 1, not added later. Follow these principles:

### Authentication & Authorization
- **Password Requirements**: Minimum 12 characters, uppercase, lowercase, numbers, special characters
- **JWT Configuration**: 30-minute expiration, HS256 algorithm, automatic refresh
- **Rate Limiting**: 10 req/min for auth, 100 req/min for general APIs, 5 req/min for backtesting
- **2FA Support**: Optional two-factor authentication for enhanced security

### Multi-tenant Isolation
- PostgreSQL RLS policies enforce data separation at database level
- Every query automatically filtered by tenant_id
- Cross-tenant access attempts logged and blocked
- Audit trail for all financial operations

### Input Validation & Sanitization
- Pydantic models validate all API inputs with strict type checking
- SQL injection prevention through SQLAlchemy ORM with parameterized queries
- XSS protection via input sanitization middleware
- File upload validation for type and size constraints

### Security Headers & Middleware
```python
SECURITY_HEADERS = {
    "X-Content-Type-Options": "nosniff",
    "X-Frame-Options": "DENY",
    "X-XSS-Protection": "1; mode=block",
    "Strict-Transport-Security": "max-age=31536000"
}
```

### Financial Data Protection
- All financial operations require audit logging
- Trade confirmations require explicit user approval
- Encryption at rest for sensitive data
- No logging of sensitive information (API keys, passwords)

|------|-------------|--------|------------|-------|
| Market Data API Outage | Medium | High | Multiple providers + circuit breakers | Backend |
| Database Scaling | High | Medium | Read replicas + connection pooling | DevOps |
| Security Breach | Low | Critical | Penetration testing + monitoring | Security |
| Claude API Rate Limits | Medium | High | Fallback modes + caching | AI Team |

#### Rollback Strategy (Zero-Downtime)
```markdown
## Emergency Rollback Procedures

### Database Migrations
- All migrations must have tested rollback scripts
- Backup created automatically before major schema changes
- Rollback tested in staging environment first

### Service Deployments
- Blue-green deployment with health checks
- Feature flags for instant disable
- Container rollback to previous stable version

### Critical Feature Failures
- AI Agent ‚Üí Fallback to traditional UI
- Live Trading ‚Üí Automatic paper mode
- Market Data ‚Üí Switch to backup provider
```

### Frontend Testing Strategy (Production-Grade)

#### Test Pyramid Implementation
```javascript
// Unit Tests (60-70%) - Fast, isolated
describe('PortfolioCalculator', () => {
  it('calculates risk parity allocation correctly', () => {
    const assets = [/* test data */];
    const result = calculateRiskParity(assets);
    expect(result.totalWeight).toBeCloseTo(1.0);
  });
});

// Integration Tests (20-30%) - Component + API
describe('UniverseCreation', () => {
  it('creates universe with real asset validation', async () => {
    render(<UniverseEditor />);
    await userEvent.type(screen.getByRole('textbox'), 'AAPL');
    await userEvent.click(screen.getByText('Add Asset'));
    
    // Tests actual API integration
    await waitFor(() => {
      expect(screen.getByText('Asset validated')).toBeInTheDocument();
    });
  });
});

// E2E Tests (5-10%) - Full user journeys
describe('Complete Strategy Creation', () => {
  it('creates strategy from universe to backtest', () => {
    cy.visit('/universes');
    cy.createUniverse(['AAPL', 'GOOGL']);
    cy.addIndicators(['RSI', 'MACD']);
    cy.runBacktest();
    cy.get('[data-testid="backtest-results"]').should('contain', 'Sharpe Ratio');
  });
});
```
